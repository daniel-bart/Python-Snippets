# Python-Snippets of little Raspberry Pi Project

Python Scripts used in combination with a motion sensor, switch, relay circuit (for lamps), telegram bot and a display for showing messages and pictures via info-beamer as well as playing custom sounds etc.

Some big improvements can be made in the text splitting part of the telegram bot.
